    <h1>theTaxologist v0.3.16</h1>
    Hi, welcome to theTaxologist v0.3.16! Here you'll find all kinds of stuff about...<br>
    <i>Taxonomy [botany]</i><br><br>
    Start <a href="/kingdom/plantae">Here!</a><br>
    Plants are usually categorized as a "kingdom" of plants.<br>
    That kingdom is divided into the phylum (pl. phyla).<br>
    In turn phyla are divided into classes, which are divided into orders, which are divided into families,<br>
    Which in turn are divided into the genus (pl. genera), which are divided into species.<br>
    We currently have...<br>
    <ul>
        <li>{{ phylums }} phyla</li>
        <li>{{ classes }} classes</li>
        <li>{{ orders }} orders</li>
        <li>{{ families }} families</li>
        <li>{{ genera }} genera</li>
        <li>{{ species }} species</li>
    </ul>
